		<blockquote><p>There are many types of servers, including web servers, mail servers, and virtual servers.</p></blockquote>

		<h2><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/about/">Node.js</a></h2>
		<blockquote><p>Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser.</p></blockquote>
		<p><b>What does it do? :</b>Node.js brings event-driven programming to web servers, enabling development of fast web servers in JavaScript. Developers can create scalable servers without using threading, by using a simplified model of event-driven programming that uses callbacks to signal the completion of a task.</p>
